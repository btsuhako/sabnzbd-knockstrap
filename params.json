{"name":"Sabnzbd-knockstrap","tagline":"An interface/theme for SABnzbd","body":"Knockstrap\r\n==================\r\n\r\nforked from [aforty](https://github.com/aforty/sabnzbd-knockstrap)\r\n\r\n### What is this?\r\nKnockstrap is a theme for [SABnzbd](http://sabnzbd.org/), the popular automated Usenet download tool. It brings a larger, more modern, brighter and cleaner look to one of your favorite tools.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n* Clean interface: Large fonts, clean layout, easy to navigate\r\n* Responsive design: looks great on all your devices\r\n* Rewritten: Completely rewritten from scratch, not based on Plush\r\n* Update system: it will inform you when a new version of Knockstrap is available\r\n* Uses [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com/), [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com), and [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/)\r\n\r\n### How to I install it?\r\nJust download, extract and move the containing `Knockstrap` directory into the interfaces directory in your SABnzbd installation.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can clone directly from GitHub and I trust you to know how to do that. \r\n\r\n### It's missing something!\r\nYes I'm aware that despite my best efforts this still lacks in a few aspects behind the built-in Plush theme. Good news though, this is GitHub! So, fork the project, grab your favorite text editor, make the changes you need and send me a pull request. \r\n\r\n### Code? I only want to change the look...\r\nSo you know CSS? Right on, I made it so that you can easily change the look and feel while keeping the code base. Fork the project, add a new CSS file as `Knockstrap/templates/static/stylesheets/colorschemes/yourname.css`. Next time you relaunch SABnzbd you will see your color scheme in the themes drop down as 'Knockstrap - yourname'. Cool huh? I've also included some themes from [Bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/)\r\n\r\nIs it good enough to share with everyone else? I'd love to include it, send a pull request so that you can get proper credit. \r\n\r\n### Why did you do this?\r\nWhy does anyone do anything? I got bored. Well, I also wanted a theme that would play well on both mobile and desktop, since mobile and tablet are quickly becoming my #1 way of using this tool. SABnzbd offers a secondary mobile skin, but separate sites for desktop and mobile? How 2005. I needed a responsive design. I found that there were some core layout problems and oddities that stopped me from giving this kind of responsive makeover to Plush. So I needed to redo this from scratch and the fastest way I knew how was Twitter's [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). So out of the box Knockstrap is responsive and looks great at any screen size. \r\n\r\nWhile I was at it, I wasn't going to use Cheetah's somewhat arcane markup language either. Template files with special markup that get parsed on the server on every request? No thanks. So I was going to rebuild this as a client side javascript app, pulling info as needed from the available json api. Client side MVVM anyone? Enter [Knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/). \r\n\r\nCombine these two and you have the magic sauce for a beautiful and responsive client side application worthy of SABnzbd. Hope you enjoy!\r\n\r\n### I need to contact you!\r\nOk, follow me on Twitter [@btsuhako](http://twitter.com/btsuhako), or head over to the [original forum thread](http://forums.sabnzbd.org/viewtopic.php?t=12626) and post your thoughts or questions. \r\n","google":"UA-43565211-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
