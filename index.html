<h3>
<a name="what-is-this" class="anchor" href="#what-is-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is this?</h3>

<p>Knockstrap is a theme for <a href="http://sabnzbd.org/">SABnzbd</a>, the popular automated Usenet download tool. It brings a larger, more modern, brighter and cleaner look to one of your favorite tools.</p>

<h3>
<a name="features" class="anchor" href="#features"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Clean interface: Large fonts, clean layout, easy to navigate</li>
<li>Responsive design: looks great on all your devices</li>
<li>Rewritten: Completely rewritten from scratch, not based on Plush</li>
<li>Update system: it will inform you when a new version of Knockstrap is available</li>
<li>Uses <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a>, <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap 3</a>, and <a href="http://bootswatch.com/">Bootswatch</a>
</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="how-to-i-install-it" class="anchor" href="#how-to-i-install-it"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to I install it?</h3>

<p>Just download, extract and move the containing <code>Knockstrap</code> directory into the interfaces directory in your SABnzbd installation.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can clone directly from GitHub and I trust you to know how to do that. </p>

<h3>
<a name="its-missing-something" class="anchor" href="#its-missing-something"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>It's missing something!</h3>

<p>Yes I'm aware that despite my best efforts this still lacks in a few aspects behind the built-in Plush theme. Good news though, this is GitHub! So, fork the project, grab your favorite text editor, make the changes you need and send me a pull request. </p>

<h3>
<a name="code-i-only-want-to-change-the-look" class="anchor" href="#code-i-only-want-to-change-the-look"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code? I only want to change the look...</h3>

<p>So you know CSS? Right on, I made it so that you can easily change the look and feel while keeping the code base. Fork the project, add a new CSS file as <code>Knockstrap/templates/static/stylesheets/colorschemes/yourname.css</code>. Next time you relaunch SABnzbd you will see your color scheme in the themes drop down as 'Knockstrap - yourname'. Cool huh? I've also included some themes from <a href="https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch/">Bootswatch</a></p>

<p>Is it good enough to share with everyone else? I'd love to include it, send a pull request so that you can get proper credit. </p>

<h3>
<a name="why-did-you-do-this" class="anchor" href="#why-did-you-do-this"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why did you do this?</h3>

<p>Why does anyone do anything? I got bored. Well, I also wanted a theme that would play well on both mobile and desktop, since mobile and tablet are quickly becoming my #1 way of using this tool. SABnzbd offers a secondary mobile skin, but separate sites for desktop and mobile? How 2005. I needed a responsive design. I found that there were some core layout problems and oddities that stopped me from giving this kind of responsive makeover to Plush. So I needed to redo this from scratch and the fastest way I knew how was Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>. So out of the box Knockstrap is responsive and looks great at any screen size. </p>

<p>While I was at it, I wasn't going to use Cheetah's somewhat arcane markup language either. Template files with special markup that get parsed on the server on every request? No thanks. So I was going to rebuild this as a client side javascript app, pulling info as needed from the available json api. Client side MVVM anyone? Enter <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>. </p>

<p>Combine these two and you have the magic sauce for a beautiful and responsive client side application worthy of SABnzbd. Hope you enjoy!</p>
